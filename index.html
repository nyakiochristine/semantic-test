            <h2>Tafaria Castle Staycation Experience Experience</h2>
            <p>If you are looking for a get away staycation away from these streets you should definitely consider this breathtaking
                castle located in the heart of Nyandarua. Something to consider when planning for the trip would be
                heavy clothes due to the chilly weather that is prevalent almost throughout the year.
                Also do not leave your cowboy hats, boots and cargo pants  since at the castle you will 
                have the chance to ride horses. Another amazing is the fact that there is a museum. I really loved some of the aesthetics of the museum. 
                But how can I forget the amazing scenary views such as the icy Aberdare Ranges from the comfort of your staycation room.
                Entrance fees are quite affordable. I am assuring you that the place will be worth the stay.
